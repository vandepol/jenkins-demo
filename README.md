# Customer Order Services - JavaEE Enterprise Application - WebSphere Liberty Repository.
=======

## Summary
This application has been modified from the initial [WebSphere ND v8.5.5 version](https://github.ibm.com/CASE/cloudpak-for-applications/tree/was855) to run on WebSphere Liberty and deployed by the IBM CloudPak for Applications. A summary of the changes can be found [here](https://github.ibm.com/CASE/cloudpak-for-applications/blob/master/liberty-build.md)

This application is a simple store-front shopping application, built during the early days of the Web 2.0 movement. This branch is the reference implementation of a modernization journey to move the monolithic application to the WebSphere Liberty cloud-ready runtime with the minimum effort and code changes

  The diagram below shows the high level decision flow where IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor is used to analyze existing assets and a decision is made to move the monolithic application to the Liberty container.

## Application Overview
The application is a simple store-front shopping application, built during the early days of the Web 2.0 movement. As such, it is in major need of upgrades from both the technology and business point of view.  Users interact directly with a browser-based interface and manage their cart to submit orders.  This application is built using the traditional [3-Tier Architecture](http://www.tonymarston.net/php-mysql/3-tier-architecture.html) model, with an HTTP server, an application server, and a supporting database.

![Phase 0 Application Architecture](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-jee/raw/master/static/imgs/apparch-pc-phase0-customerorderservices.png)

There are several components of the overall application architecture:
- Starting with the database, the application leverages two SQL-based databases running on [IBM DB2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/).
- The application exposes its data model through an [Enterprise JavaBean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_JavaBeans) layer, named **CustomerOrderServices**.  This components leverages the [Java Persistence API](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Persistence/What_is_JPA%3F) to exposed the backend data model to calling services with minimal coding effort.
  - This build of the application uses JavaEE6 features for EJBs and JPA.
- The next tier of the application, named **CustomerOrderServicesWeb**, exposes the necessary business APIs via REST-based web services.  This component leverages the [JAX-RS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_RESTful_Web_Services) libraries for creating Java-based REST services with minimal coding effort.
  - This build of the application is using **JAX-RS 1.1** version of the respective capability.
- The application's user interface is exposed through the **CustomerOrderServicesWeb** component as well, in the form of a [Dojo Toolkit](#tbd)-based JavaScript application.  Delivering the user interface and business APIs in the same component is one major inhibitor our migration strategy will help to alleviate in the long-term.
- Finally, there is an additional integration testing component, named **CustomerOrderServicesTest** that is built to quickly validate an application's build and deployment to a given application server.  This test component contains both **JPA** and **JAX-RS**-based tests.
